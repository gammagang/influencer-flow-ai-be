# InfluencerFlow AI Platform — MVP Plan

## App Overview & Objectives

InfluencerFlow AI Platform is designed to revolutionize influencer marketing for brands by automating the most manual, fragmented parts of the process: discovering relevant creators, reaching out with personalized messaging, negotiating deals, generating contracts, and managing campaigns — all powered by AI. The MVP focuses on the Instagram ecosystem and prioritizes a seamless experience for brands to find creators, initiate collaborations, and track campaign progress with minimal friction.

**Objective:**  
Deliver a working MVP in 3 days that demonstrates the core end-to-end flow for a brand user: creator discovery (real data), personalized AI outreach (email), negotiation summary, contract generation/signing, mock payment, and campaign tracking.

---

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Brand managers, agencies, and marketers seeking to launch or scale influencer campaigns on Instagram.
- **Future:** Platform expansion for creators/influencers to manage inbound brand requests, track deals, and manage their own profiles.

## Core Features & Functionality (MVP Scope)

### 1. Creator Discovery Engine (Instagram Only) — Must Have

- Live search and filtering of real Instagram creators using free/public APIs or RapidAPI (no mock data).
- Filter by niche, follower range, engagement, budget, and keywords.
- Creator profile cards: show audience insights, engagement metrics, and available public info.

### 2. Brand Profile Generation — Must Have

- Brands can create/enrich their profile by entering website and key details.
- Platform scrapes and summarizes website info via AI to build a detailed brand identity.
- Stored for use in future outreach and campaign personalization.

### 3. AI-Powered Outreach (Email) — Must Have

- Automated, personalized email generation using Groq LLM, sent via SendGrid.
- Customizes each outreach using brand and creator profile data.
- All outreach activity logged in a simple CRM view for the brand.

### 4. Voice-Based Negotiation (Must Have)

After AI-generated email outreach, the email contains a unique link that redirects the creator to a branded negotiation page on your platform.
On this page, an in-browser voice call (using ElevenLabs or similar API) is initiated between the AI agent and the creator.
The AI agent is programmed with clear instructions, negotiation guardrails (scenario, deliverables, negotiation price range, fallback options), and conducts the negotiation on the brand’s behalf.
If the call runs over 5 minutes or cannot be finalized, the platform offers the option to request a manual (human) call, or allows the negotiation to continue offline (email/WhatsApp).
All voice calls and negotiation outcomes are logged, and key data is used to auto-populate the deal summary for contract generation.

### 5. Negotiation & Deal Summary — Must Have (Simplified)

- Negotiation can happen off-platform (email, WhatsApp, etc.).
- Brand user fills a form summarizing agreed terms (deliverables, price, timeline, payment model).
- Terms are stored and used to generate a contract.

### 6. Contract Generation & E-Signature — Must Have

- Auto-generate contract (PDF) using confirmed deal terms.
- E-signature integration (open-source or template-based) for both parties.
- Contract status visible to brand.

### 7. Payment Processing — Mock for MVP

- Simulated payment flow using Stripe/Razorpay sandbox.
- Payment structure options: on completion, split, milestone-based.
- Payment status tracked in the dashboard.

### 8. Campaign Tracker & Performance Dashboard — Must Have (Simplified)

- Show campaign details, delivered Instagram content (posts/reels).
- Extract and display post-level engagement metrics via Instagram API if available.
- Simple dashboard for brands to track progress and results.

## User Interface Design Flows

### Brand User Flow (End-to-End MVP)

1. **Sign Up / Login** (Google Auth/OAuth)
2. **Brand Profile Setup**
   - Enter website, fill basic info — AI scrapes and builds profile
3. **Campaign Creation**
   - Specify campaign goals, niche, budget, deliverables, etc.
4. **Creator Discovery**
   - Search/filter real Instagram creators; view profiles; shortlist
5. **AI Outreach**
   - Select creators; platform generates and sends personalized outreach emails
6. **Negotiation**
   - Takes place off-platform; brand logs final terms via a form
7. **Contract Generation**
   - Platform auto-generates PDF contract; both parties e-sign
8. **Payment**
   - Brand triggers payment via mock flow; status is tracked
9. **Campaign Tracking**
   - Brand uploads or links delivered content; platform displays engagement metrics and campaign summary
10. **Dashboard**

- View all campaigns, status, contracts, payments, and analytics

---

## Security Considerations

- Store only essential data; use OAuth for authentication.
- Secure all API keys/secrets (never expose on frontend).
- Encrypt sensitive deal and contract information in the database.
- E-signature process should include basic audit trails (timestamps, IPs).
- Limit access to brand data via role-based permissions (brands only for MVP).

---

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

- **Instagram API Limitations:** Free/public endpoints may limit data richness or require workarounds.  
  _Solution:_ Use the best available free APIs; clearly document any data limitations in the demo.

- **Personalization Quality:** Quality of scraped brand/creator profiles may vary.  
  _Solution:_ Let brands review/edit AI summaries before outreach.

- **E-signature Integration:** Open-source solutions may have UX or reliability issues.  
  _Solution:_ Use a proven template-based approach; test flows with sample contracts.

- **Timeline Constraints:** 3 days is tight for integration.  
  _Solution:_ Prioritize core flows; mock/simplify where needed; voice outreach and admin panel are optional.

## Future Expansion Possibilities

- Add support for YouTube and other platforms for creator discovery and analytics.
- Onboard creators as users, enabling them to receive/manage offers and contracts directly.
- Voice-based and WhatsApp-based outreach with AI agents.
- Full campaign performance analytics, including ROI and multi-channel reporting.
- Automated negotiation bots for on-platform dealmaking.
- Admin panel for advanced data management and user roles.
